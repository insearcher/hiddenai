# Privacy Policy for HiddenAI

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how HiddenAI ("the Application") handles your data. The Application is designed with privacy in mind and operates primarily on your local device.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What We Collect

The Application collects and processes the following data:

1. **OpenAI API Key**: Stored locally in UserDefaults.
2. **Audio Recordings**: Temporarily stored on your device during the transcription process.
3. **Screenshots**: Temporarily stored on your device during the analysis process.
4. **User Settings**: Preferences like window transparency and custom AI context instructions.
5. **Conversation History**: Chat messages between you and the AI assistant during your session.

### How We Use Your Data

- **OpenAI API Key**: Used exclusively to authenticate requests to OpenAI's API services.
- **Audio Recordings**: Used only for local processing and transcription via OpenAI's Whisper API.
- **Screenshots**: Used only for local processing and analysis via OpenAI's Vision API.
- **User Settings**: Used to customize the application experience.
- **Conversation History**: Used to maintain context during your session. History is not preserved between application restarts unless explicitly saved by you.

### Data Sharing

The Application does not share your data with any third parties except:

- **OpenAI**: When you use features that require the OpenAI API (using your provided API key), the necessary data (text, audio recordings, screenshots) is transmitted to OpenAI for processing according to their [privacy policy](https://openai.com/privacy).

## Data Storage

All data collected by the Application is stored locally on your device, with the exception of:

- Data sent to OpenAI for processing, which is subject to OpenAI's data retention policies.

## Your Rights

As the Application operates locally on your device, you have complete control over your data:

- You can delete temporary files created by the Application.
- You can reset your settings at any time.
- You can choose not to provide your OpenAI API key, though this will limit functionality.

## Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your data:

- Your OpenAI API key is stored in UserDefaults.
- The Application does not transmit any data except to OpenAI when needed for processing.
- No analytics or telemetry data is collected.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the application's repository.
